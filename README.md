# WICDPR: Winch-Integrated Cable-Driven Parallel Robots for Agriculture

## Project Overview

This repository contains the full open-source hardware, software, and documentation for both 2D and 3D Winch-Integrated Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (WICDPRs).  
These robots are designed for rapid deployment and high-precision motion in agricultural environments (e.g., greenhouses, field plots), minimizing soil compaction and maximizing flexibility by keeping all winches on the mobile platform.
## System Features

- **2D and 3D platforms:** Planar and spatial robots for different workspace needs.
- **Real-time feedback:** Rotary encoders and MPU6050 IMU for position and tilt.
- **Double-loop PID control:** Zieglerâ€“Nichols tuned, with auto-leveling.
- **Teleoperation:** Manual control using ROS teleop nodes.
- **Safety:** E-stop support, tension checks, WiFi router for secure SSH.
- **Comprehensive docs:** Bills of Materials (BOM), STL files, wiring diagrams, and demo videos.
