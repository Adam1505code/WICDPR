# WICDPR: Winch-Integrated Cable-Driven Parallel Robots for Agriculture

## Project Overview

This repository contains the complete open-source hardware and software for both 2D and 3D Winch-Integrated Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (WICDPRs). These robots are designed for rapid deployment in agricultural environments—such as greenhouses or field plots—where soil compaction and flexibility are key concerns. The system features both planar (2D) and spatial (3D) designs, leveraging on-platform winches, ROS-based PID control, IMU feedback, and modular electronics.

## System Features

- **2D and 3D Cable-Driven Platforms:** Modular design for planar and full spatial control.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Rotary encoders and IMU (MPU6050) for position and tilt.
- **Double-Loop PID Control:** Robust movement and self-leveling using Ziegler–Nichols-tuned gains.
- **Teleoperation:** Manual keyboard control via ROS teleop nodes.
- **Safety:** E-stop, cable tension checks, WiFi router for secure SSH access.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Bills of materials (BOM), wiring diagrams, STL files, and videos.
